# Greek Tower Defense

Our take on the classic Tower Defense genre using Unity game engine and C#

## What is Greek Tower Defense?

In our game, Greek Tower Defense, players can play as Greek monsters, fighting against the gods and their minions. In this game, players can receive the nostalgia of an old-fashioned tower defense game and the excitement of a modern gacha game.
This game is the perfect product for older gamers, younger gamers, and any new gamers who are just starting out.
Finally, families of all sizes can sit down and enjoy a game catered to everyone.
We chose this product because we all have varying experiences with gaming. We wanted to build a game that we could all enjoy. We also discussed the tragedy of always being the enemy so we gave monsters a voice.
